    Metroid Prime: Trilogy is a compilation of action-adventure games developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console.
    It features three games from the Metroid series: Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. Prime and Echoes, which were
    originally developed on the GameCube in the early 2000s, were updated with many of the features that were first implemented in Corruption, such as a
    new control scheme based on the Wii Remote and a credits system that was supported by WiiConnect24.

    The compilation was first announced by Nintendo in May 2009, and was released in North America in August 2009, followed by its European and Australian
    releases in September and October respectively. It was not released in Japan because the ports of Prime and Echoes were released as standalone games in
    the New Play Control! series in that region. In January 2010, Nintendo discontinued the Metroid Prime: Trilogy in both North America and Australia.
    Metroid Prime: Trilogy was well received by critics, with much praise to the new controls. It was later re-released on the Wii U's Nintendo eShop in
    January 2015.
